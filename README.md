# Identical shops in Skroutz 

The following code, when provided with the urls of some products in Skroutz, selects those shops that will result in 
the minimum cost. 

Notes:
1) The file containing the urls should be named 'product_urls.txt'
2) The results are printed in a .csv file
3) The website Skroutz.gr updates its UI regurarly, so in case the code does not work modifications in the xpath are 
required (look class_shop.py).
