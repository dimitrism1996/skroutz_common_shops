# Identical shops in Skroutz 

The following code, when provided with the urls of some products in Skroutz, finds those shops that provide the majority of 
products in attempt to minimize transportation and exchange fees. 

Notes:
1) The file containing the urls should be named 'product_urls.txt'
2) The results are printed in a .csv file
3) The website Skroutz.gr updates its UI regurarly, so in case the code does not work modifications in the xpath are required (look class_shop.py).
